# redacted OS

redacted OS is a TTY-first, Arch-based Linux project focused on control, transparency, and learning.

The live environment boots directly into a terminal, allowing users to either perform a fully manual installation or follow a guided TTY installer. After installation, users can configure and launch a desktop environment with clean defaults, consistent branding, and accessibility options.

redacted OS prioritizes clarity and understanding over heavy automation, while remaining flexible and customizable.

This project is independent and not affiliated with or endorsed by Arch Linux.
